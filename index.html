            Drivechains is a controversial proposal aiming to allow for the
            creation of sidechains containing coins meant to be pegged 1:1 to
            Bitcoin. Here we will analyze what drivechains actually proposes,
            technical flaws of drivechains, how drivechains could affect Bitcoin
            itself, and finally, discuss whether or not the idea is actually
            likely to see significant usage.

          </p>

          <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
          <p>
            To understand drivechains, let’s start with the motivation. Paul
            Sztorc’s own Hivemind proposal is a good example. Hivemind is meant
            to be a prediction market, where people can place
            Bitcoin-denominated bets on real-world outcomes. The specifics of
            Hivemind are not important here. What is important, is that Hivemind
            aims to accomplish two things:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Implement rules that the Bitcoin community is unwilling to add to
              the Bitcoin protocol.
            </li>
            <li>Apply those rules to BTC held in escrow.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The challenge here is implementing the escrow. One way is of course
            to simply use a federation. Blockstream Liquid, for example,
            implements this by holding the escrow BTC in an 11-of-15 multisig,
            with the functionaries who can sign that multisig also signing
            blocks in the Liquid consensus protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Liquid’s federated multisig is a compromise. Prior to launching
            Liquid in 2018, Blockstream proposed the use of a hashrate escrow in
            their 2014 Pegged Sidechains paper. However, for reasons we will now
            analyze, Blockstream gave up on the idea.
          </p>

          <h2 id="hashrate-escrows">Hashrate Escrows</h2>
          <p>
            Essentially all transaction outputs in the existing Bitcoin system
            are protected by public key cryptography. Recall that in Bitcoin,
            specific transaction outputs are associated with scriptPubKey’s,
            small computer programs whose conditions must be satisfied for an
            output to be spendable. Essentially all transaction outputs are
            protected by scriptPubKeys with a form similar to the following:
          </p>
          <pre><code>&lt;pubkey&gt; CheckSig</code></pre>
          <p>
            A transaction spending such a transaction output is only valid if a
            valid signature is provided, which causes the CheckSig to return
            true. This means that miners can not simply steal coins from the
            perspective of a fully validating node:               <span
            class="highlight"
            data-critique="intro-4"
            style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)"
          >no amount of Bitcoin hash
            power can fake a digital signature.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the pegged sidechains proposal, Blockstream proposed the idea of
            a hashrate escrow, treating hash power as a dynamic-membership
            multiparty signature (DMMS). The simplest possible example of a
            hashrate escrow is the scriptPubKey:
          </p>
          <pre><code>True</code></pre>
          <p>
            Since this script simply returns true, no cryptographic signature is
            needed. Such scripts are often called “anyone-can-spend” scripts.
            However this term is slightly misleading: it’s miners who produce
            blocks, so strictly speaking, only miners can spend that output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, if an output can be spent by <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-5" style="background-color: rgba(76, 0, 255, 0.2)">surely it will
            just be stolen</span> by any miner, right? Probably! Blockstream proposed to fix this
            problem with two main mitigations:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Multisig: multiple blocks would have to approve a spend of
              hashrate-escrowed funds. Blockstream’s paper suggested one or two
              days worth of blocks; 144 to 288 blocks total.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fraud proofs: once the spend was approved, there would be an
              additional one to two day waiting period where proofs of
              fraudulent transfer could be published on the Bitcoin chain,
              potentially cancelling the spend before it actually happens. This
              idea is similar in spirit to Lightning’s justice transactions,
              with the very important difference that Lightning’s justice
              transactions are actually implemented and have been <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-6" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">proven to work
              in the wild.</span>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In my discussions with some of the authors of the pegged sidechains
            paper, I’ve been told that one of the main things — in their view —
            that halted the pegged sidechains project was that actually
            <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-7" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">implementing fraud proofs turned out to be much more difficult than
            they had hoped.</span>
          </p>

          <h3 id="bip-300-the-drivechain-take-on-hashrate-escrows">
            BIP-300: The Drivechain Take on Hashrate Escrows
          </h3>
          <p>
            The first part of the drivechains proposal, BIP-300, describes a
            hashrate escrow scheme. As per the BIP-300 introduction:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              In Bip300, txns are not signed via cryptographic key. Instead,
              they are “signed” by hashpower, over time. Like a big multisig,
              13150-of-26300, where each block is a new “signature”.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Unlike Blockstream’s proposal, BIP-300 does not have any concept of
            fraud proofs. As the BIP-300 introduction suggests, BIP-300 is a
            strict hashrate escrow where miners unilaterally decide if and how
            to spend the escrowed coins, regardless of what rules the associated
            drivechain is meant to enforce. This includes spending coins in ways
            that some people may characterize as “theft”.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Blockstream proposed relatively short, one to two day, voting
            and fraud proof periods, BIP-300 proposes much longer timescales of
            approximately 3 to 6 months. Concretely, to withdraw coins from the
            BIP-300 hashrate escrow, a miner must propose the hash of what is
            supposed to be a “bundle” of transaction outputs in their coinbase
            to pay. Following that proposal, in the next 26300 blocks —
            approximately 6 months — at least 13150 blocks must ACKs that
            specific bundle in the coinbase transaction. If the bundle is
            successful, a transaction may be included in the block spending some
            or all of the escrowed funds to the bundled transaction outputs.
          </p>
          <p>There’s some more details in the BIP itself, for instance the fact that specific drivechains must first be proposed by a supermajority of hashing power, the downvote/alarm functionality, etc. But the exact details aren’t particularly important to this critique. What is important, is to understand that miners vote to decide what to do with the escrowed coins, that the vote happens over a long time period, and that there is <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-8" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">no mechanism to challenge a vote with a proof of fraud/theft.</span></p>

          <h4 id="other-unimportant-bip-300-criticism">
            Other Unimportant BIP-300 Criticism
          </h4>
          <p>
            While an unimportant criticism in the overall context of what we
            just discussed, I’ll also point out that the inclusion of human
            readable names, descriptions, tarball hashes, git commit hashes,
            etc. in the BIP-300 specification is <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-9" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">very silly, amateur mistake.</span>
            Obviously, any real use of a drivechain would not start with
            <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-10" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">non-consensus-enforced information obtained on a blockchain.</span> The
            inclusion of such fields merely serves to aid in fraudulent attempts
            at confusing users.
          </p>

          <h2 id="bip-301-blind-merge-mining">BIP-301: Blind Merge Mining</h2>
          <p>
            The second part of the drivechains proposal aims to provide a
            consensus mechanism. This BIP describes itself as a form of merge
            mining, with the crucial difference that rather than have miners run
            full nodes for the merge-mined chain, they are simply paid to
            blindly commit to that chain in transactions via a fee-bidding
            mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Merge mining itself is a very old idea, pioneered by Namecoin in
            2010. Essentially a merge-mined coin has consensus rules such a
            valid attempt at finding a mainchain (eg Bitcoin) block can
            simultaneously be a valid attempt at finding a merge-mined coin
            block.
          </p>
          <p>
            BIP-301 doesn’t actually specify in detail how a blind-mined chain
            is meant to actually form a consensus. Those specific rules would be
            part of the blind-mined chain’s consensus, not Bitcoin itself.
            However it’s notable that for <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-11" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">the most obvious and efficient way of
            implementing those rules, BIP-301 has a serious cryptographic flaw</span>
            which we will discuss separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to Bitcoin, you can think of BIP-301 as a mechanism
            where mining a special type of transaction requires a miner to also
            add a specific OP_Return output to their coinbase transaction that
            commits to 32-bytes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since only one such transaction can be included, the economically
            rational outcome of the mechanism is a fee-based auction: highest
            fee wins.
          </p>

          <h3 id="equivocation-attack">Equivocation Attack</h3>
          <p>
            As per BIP-301, the result of an accepted Blind Merge Mined block is
            that an OP_Return output in the following format is added to the
            coinbase:
          </p>
          <pre><code>1-byte - OP_RETURN (0x6a)
4-bytes - Message header (0xD1617368)
32-bytes - h* (obtained from Simon)</code></pre>
          <p>
            An obvious problem with this design is it’s subject to equivocation
            attacks. The obvious and efficient implementation of a merge mined
            chain is to <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-11" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">use a SPV proof to the coinbase transaction</span> to prove
            that a block has been blind-merge-mined. But since the OP_Return
            format doesn’t commit to which chain is being blind-merge-mined, a
            miner could in fact include multiple conflicting OP_Return
            transactions at the same block height. This is similar to the
            “double-proof” problem that Namecoin solved back in 2011.
          </p>
          <p>
            An obvious solution would be to tag the OP_Return outputs with some
            kind of merge-mined chain identifier, and implement a strict rule
            consensus rule in the blind-merge-mined chain where the first
            matching tag wins.
          </p>

          <h3 id="reorgs-invalidating-coins">Reorgs Invalidating Coins</h3>
          <p>The blind-merge-mine request has the following format:</p>
          <pre><code>3-bytes - Message header (0x00bf00)
32-bytes  - h* (side:MerkleRoot)
1-byte  - nSidechain (sidechain ID number)
4-bytes - prevMainHeaderBytes (the last four bytes of the previous main:block)</code></pre>
          <p>
            The last field, prevMainHeaderBytes, is designed to commit to the
            previous block header, ensuring that a blind-merge-mined request
            transaction is only valid in a specific block. This directly
            conflicts with an important principle of Bitcoin consensus design:
            <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-12" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">reorgs should not invalidate transactions.</span> For example, this is <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-13" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">why
            coinbase outputs are only spendable after 100 blocks</span>, and <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-14" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">why we
            have not and will not implement consensus-level transaction expiry.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            A way to fix this would be to limit request transactions to
            containing exactly one output, an OP_Return containing the request
            message.

            The Lack of BIP-301 and BIP-300 Interaction
          </h2>
          <p>
            A very notable omission in BIP-301 is that BIP-301 <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-15" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">does not interact
            with BIP-300 Hashrate Escrows.</span> There is no mechanism to pay miners
            to ACK or NACK a specific BIP-300 hashrate escrow withdrawal
            proposal. The only way that coins can be withdrawn from a drivechain
            is by the direct participation of at least a majority of hash power
            over the 3 to 6 month withdrawal period.
          </p>
          <p>
            BIP-301 clearly states in the Motivation section that it is intended
            to fix drawbacks of traditional merge mining, including the fact
            that in traditional merge mining:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Miners must run a full node of the other chain(s). (Thus, they
              must run “non-Bitcoin” software which may be buggy.)
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            But this obviously <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-16" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">conflicts with the requirement that miners either
            run drivechain full nodes</span>, or <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-17" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">trust</span> others to run them for them, to
            safely allow withdrawals to happen. If miners are not doing that,
            either coins become stuck, or they become subject to theft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frankly, when I first learned about drivechains I had assumed that
            the blind-merge-mine mechanism also allowed for <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-18" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">blind withdrawal
            proposals of some kind</span> given the decentralization claims around
            drivechains. I was shocked when I learned otherwise. The proposal
            simply punts on this obvious <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-19" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">issue,</span> with no solution.
          </p>
          <p>We’ll discuss the implications of this omission further.</p>

          <h2 id="analysis-how-can-drivechains-affect-bitcoin">
            Analysis: How Can Drivechains Affect Bitcoin?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Now that we’ve covered how the drivechain proposal works, along with
            some more obvious flaws, we can analyze how drivechains can affect
            Bitcoin. Let’s start with <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-20" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">our goals</span>. We want Bitcoin to be:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong><em>Useful</em></strong
              >: Bitcoin must continue to allow people to provide a store of
              value and medium of exchange, which collectively comprise the vast
              majority of what people use Bitcoin for.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><em>Secure</em></strong
              >: Bitcoin must continue to be useful even in the face of attack.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><em>Decentralized</em></strong
              >: in achieving goal #2, we do not trust any <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">single</span> entity or
              group of entities; we assume any single entity or group of
              entities may attack Bitcoin.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The last goal has generated the bulk of the discussion around
            drivechains: do they encourage <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-21" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">centralization of Bitcoin mining?</span>
          </p>

          <h3 id="mining-centralization">Mining Centralization</h3>
          <p>
            Bitcoin mining comprises of both <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-22" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">hashing</span>, and block verification and
            production. <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-23" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">The economics of Bitcoin mining have both economies and
            diseconomies of scale.</span> These economies and diseconomies of scale act
            as centralizing and decentralizing pressures.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary diseconomy of scale is the fact that Bitcoin hashing
            consumes energy and produces heat. Opportunities to obtain cheap
            energy, and to dispose of or make use of waste heat, have inherent
            diseconomies of scale due to the fact that the cheapest energy
            production is inherently <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">spread out across the globe</span>. For example,
            flare gas and stranded/surplus renewable energy are some of the
            cheapest sources of energy available. Obviously, opportunities to
            collect flare gas and renewable energy are inherently spread across
            the globe. This is a diseconomy of scale because the maximum size of
            these operations is limited by the available energy at any one
            location. A oil well that generates 100KW of free waste flare gas in
            a given location simply can’t generate more free waste gas at any
            reasonable price.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, some hashing operations make use of their waste heat, eg
            to heat buildings. Obviously, the amount of waste heat that any one
            location can make use of is inherently limited. Again, this acts as
            a diseconomy of scale: a house that can be sufficiently heated with
            50KW of hash power simply has no use for more hash power in that
            location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grid stabilization is another example of a diseconomy of scale. Some
            Bitcoin hashing operations have been able to get credits on their
            electricity bills for providing the ability to quickly reduce their
            power usage. Obviously, the maximum amount of grid stabilization
            needed in any one geographic area is limited, creating a diseconomy
            of scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary economies of scale are in mining pools. They exist
            because of variance: with just 144 Bitcoin blocks generated per day,
            the average Bitcoin hashing operation mining blocks directly for
            themselves (solo-mining) would need to wait months or even years
            between payments. Secondly, the operating costs of a mining pool are
            <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">mostly fixed</span>: the bandwidth and compute power needed per hashing
            operation is almost zero. <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-25" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">If the overhead costs of operating the
            necessary nodes is non-trivial, there is a significant savings for a
            large pool compared to a small pool as that overhead is spread over
            more clients.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus we see that while Bitcoin hashing is quite decentralized — with
            a very large number of individual hashing operations in existence —
            the number of Bitcoin mining pools is much more limited. At the time
            of writing, the majority of hash power is spread over just two
            pools:
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/2023-10-13/hashpower-distribution.png"
            alt="Hashpower Distribution"
          />
          <p>
            While undesirable, this situation isn’t fatal as, in theory, bad
            behavior can cause hashing operations to quickly switch from one
            pool to another. Additionally, there are technologies like
            StratumV2, <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-27" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">p2pool</span>, and braidpool that <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">decentralize block production</span>
            (mining).
          </p>
          <p>
            While we don’t have space to go into details about these
            technologies, the important thing in the context of drivechains is
            that they all require hashing operations to produce blocks
            themselves, <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-28" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">requiring them to run full nodes.</span>
          </p>

          <h3 id="do-miners-need-to-run-drivechain-nodes">
            Do Miners Need to Run Drivechain Nodes?
          </h3>
          <p>Yes.</p>
          <p>
            The reason why is simple: if drivechains are to work correctly, coin
            withdrawal needs to work. Drivechains requires that a majority of
            hash power directly vote on withdrawal proposals, and <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-29" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">the only way
            to validate a withdrawal proposal for a given drivechain is to run a
            node for that drivechain.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there could be dozens, or even hundreds, of drivechains this
            is an obvious economy of scale that will significantly centralize
            mining: every one of those drivechains will have associated software
            that needs installation, maintenance, and upgrades. Those drivechain
            nodes will require bandwidth, CPU time, and storage space.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why the fact that blind merge mining and coin withdrawal
            votes are unconnected is such a glaring omission: while blind merge
            mining claims to fix the mining decentralization problem, the fact
            that withdrawal votes require direct majority miner involvement
            negates this claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suspect the reason for this omission is that the authors of
            drivechains attempted to make blind withdrawal voting, and failed
            due to it being incompatible with rational game theory: if you can
            pay money to steal coins, obviously someone will do exactly that.
            Requiring a majority of hash power to vote in favor of a coin
            withdrawal obscures this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that miners need to run drivechain nodes is particularly
            problematic to the claims that drivechains will scale Bitcoin.
            Obviously, if drivechains supporting hundreds or thousands of
            transactions per second catch on, miners will need to invest in
            thousands or tens of thousands of dollars worth of computing
            hardware and bandwidth to mine. This is completely incompatible with
            technologies that decentralize mining such as the aformentioned
            StratumV2 and p2pool/braidpool.
          </p>

          <h3 id="the-phone-a-friend-model">The “Phone a Friend” Model</h3>
          <p>
            To avoid the necessity of miners running drivechain nodes, it has
            been suggested that miners could instead just “phone a friend” and
            just copy withdrawal approval hashes from “trusted sources” like
            social media. There’s a lot of problems with this model:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Why should miners do anything at all? There’s no direct incentive
              to approving withdrawal requests, so miners have no reason to
              actually go through these steps. This is especially true in the
              case of decentralized mining tech such as StratumV2 and
              p2pool/brainpool. I personally used to mine with p2pool, and I
              never touched my configuration after setting it up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Workload: drivechain proponents imagine a future with dozens or
              even hundreds of drivechains. With a 3 to 6 month withdrawal
              period, that would require miners to research and input NACKs and
              ACKs for drivechains every week or so. Even without actually
              running drivechain software that’s an enormous increase in
              workload compared to the status quo for running a full node, where
              you might want to change software every few years for new soft
              forks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drama and legal risks due to failures: given how broken this
              system is, it’s inevitable that some drivechains will fail via
              funds getting stuck or stolen, and pressure will be put on miners
              to fix the problem.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The last is a particularly serious problem in light of Bitcoin’s
            high degree of mining centralization: a 51% majority of hash power
            can salvage a drivechain failure by 51% attacking other miners to
            overrule their votes, or lack of votes. We do not want there to be
            more incentives to 51% attack!
          </p>
          <p>
            A key thing enabling miner decentralization is the fact that at the
            moment it is still reasonably possible to form a new pool, and to
            use <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">decentralized mining pool tech</span>. The rules to create a new,
            valid, block are clear, and provided you follow those rules, you are
            not risking enormous financial loss by using a small pool or
            decentralized pool. If these rules become unclear because
            drivechains funds are being frozen or looted, that’s an enormous
            centralization <span class="highlight" data-critique="intro-24" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">pressure</span> inducing hashing power to move towards the
            largest pools.
          </p>

          <h3 id="legal-risk-do-drivechains-make-miners-custodians">
            Legal Risk: Do Drivechains Make Miners Custodians?
          </h3>
          <p>
            At the moment miners are not in a position where they can steal
            arbitrary funds. As long as people run full-nodes, even a 51% attack
            can’t steal arbitrary coins since no amount of hashing power can
            fake a digital signature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drivechains fundamentally change this. In the drivechain model,
            miners absolutely can steal funds. Does this make miners custodians?
            Maybe! It certainly invites lawsuits and court orders against miners
            to recover or seize funds. I personally am being sued by Craig
            Wright in a lawsuit aiming to do just that. I’m glad that I can
            confidently tell a court in my defense that I simply do not have the
            ability to do that. With drivechains, miners won’t have that
            defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also means that voting “incorrectly” could open miners to legal
            action. This is particularly problematic in the “phone a friend”
            model of operation where the miner isn’t making a genuine attempt to
            actually validate the drivechain. It’s easy to imagine courts
            deciding that operating in this way is negligence.
          </p>

          <h3 id="fees-and-drivechain-blocksize-limit">
            Fees and Drivechain Blocksize Limit
          </h3>
          <p>
            It’s been claimed that drivechains will benefit Bitcoin miners
            through higher fees generated via blind merge mining.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, drivechains have no mechanism to limit total blocksize, and
            indeed, they’re being promoted as a way to dramatically scale
            Bitcoin. Without a limit, it’s obvious that the supply of drivechain
            blockspace is unlimited, and thus there is no reason to expect
            economic supply and demand to converge to anything more than trivial
            fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note how this particular claim is reminiscent of big blocker claims
            from the blocksize wars.
          </p>

          <h4 id="time-value-of-money">Time Value of Money</h4>
          <p>
            If drivechains do somehow generate non-trivial fee revenue, that can
            actually centralize blind merge mining by greatly increasing the
            capital costs required to blind merge mine! The problem is that the
            creators of blind merge mined blocks have to pay transaction fees
            now, denominated in Bitcoin. But they receive the transaction fees
            in the drivechain coins. In theory those coins are supposed to be
            pegged 1:1 to BTC. But obviously, with a 3-6 month withdrawal period
            that is certainly not guaranteed to succeed, paying those fees now
            requires large amounts of liquidity and risk. Shinobi has a good
            article explaining this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sztorc has argued that swaps fix this issue. But as Shinobi
            explains, “the reality is that [swaps] just shove the liquidity
            requirements onto yet another party, assuming they will provide
            massive amounts of liquidity for almost nothing in return”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this isn’t directly a problem for Bitcoin users at first
            glance. But drivechains introduces new incentives to Bitcoin mining,
            and it would not be surprising if this blind merge mining
            centralization problem also spilled over to Bitcoin mining.

          <h2 id="are-drivechains-going-to-see-significant-usage">
            Are Drivechains Going to See Significant Usage?
          </h2>
          <p>
            In any discussion of a Bitcoin soft-fork, we have to weigh costs and
            benefits. Any soft-fork has significant costs, including technical
            risks, maintenance burdens, etc.; drivechains are not a trivial
            feature to implement due to the state required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The history of Bitcoin and altcoins has shown that the overwhelming,
            long-term, non-speculative, market demand is for the straightforward
            use-cases of secure store-of-value and cheap and convenient
            medium-of-exchange, along with a smaller niche occupied by Monero’s
            enforced privacy use-case. Of those three, drivechains clearly do
            not meet market demand for a secure store-of-value: it is obviously
            risky to leave coins on drivechains. Drivechains are also not needed
            for enforced privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            That leaves the cheap and convenient medium-of-exchange use-case.
            Unfortunately, drivechains inherently pose significant
            medium-of-exchange problems by adding to the exchange rate
            volatility problem. It is already problematic enough for the
            medium-of-exchange use-case that Bitcoin has a floating exchange
            rate relative to other currencies. While drivechains are meant to be
            1:1 pegged to Bitcoin, due to the long peg-out time windows and
            inherent risks of holding drivechain coins, drivechain coins will
            have a floating exchange rate that is likely to slip by significant
            amounts. Conversions between drivechain coins and Bitcoin will also
            not be practical without using swaps, and thus incurring transaction
            fees on top of exchange rate volatility costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an obvious UI/UX problem for drivechain wallets! We already
            see people often preferring custodial Lightning wallets over
            sophisticated non-custodial wallets like Phoenix due to their
            ability to avoid on-chain transaction fees. The transaction fees and
            exchange rate volatility drivechain coins will experience is an even
            worse version of this problem.

          <p>
            Writing this blog post has proven to be surprisingly difficult for
            me. Usually when I’m asked to review an idea, there’s a reasonable
            amount of “substance” to the idea. Concrete technical concepts and
            game theory that can be distilled down to logic and math, and
            critiqued with logic and math. For example, my 2016 post on Block
            Publication Incentives for Miners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drivechains is not like that. Drivechains is a vapid, handwavey,
            idea that replaces the careful incentive design we see in other
            Bitcoin protocols — and Bitcoin itself — with blind trust in miners.
            Of course, blind trust could very well work in practice! But if
            you’re that willing to rely on trust, why are we going to the
            trouble of using Bitcoin in the first place?

              After all - today, Blockstream promotes Liquid as 'a sidechain'.
              They engage in a micro-fraud, speaking as though nothing were
              'abandoned', and the original sidechain idea were still on-track.

              Peter and I know otherwise. The original 'sidechain' (2015) was
              not a permissioned closed-source corporate multisig, with unknown
              un-removable keyholders. In other words, it was not Liquid.
              Instead, it was a technique on L1 Bitcoin Core, by which our 21M
              BTC could freely travel to/from other blockchains. This is one
              area where Peter is accurate on sidechains.</span

However, if he is talking about the goals of all Bitcoin users -- L2 and L1 included, then he has missed the entire point of sidechains. The whole point of sidechains is that users have different needs and interests. And even the same user can have different needs on Monday than they had on Tuesday.

     It seems Peter must agree with me, on at least this: if we focus only on the L1 full nodes (ie, the Bitcoin protocol), then Drivechain cannot negatively affect of his three "Useful", "Secure", "Decentralized" qualities. For Usefulness, DC only gives users another L1 UTXO option (so Usefulness either must increase or be unchanged), and it allows them to opt-in to another Security model (only, using Bitcoin instead of an Altcoin -- thus security must increase, seemingly), and it does nothing to harm Decentralization (which I define as "the cost of starting up a new P2P node"). <br><br>Notice that Peter <em>only</em> mentions "mining centralization". He tacitly admits that your L1 full node software (and the entire L1 full node Bitcoin network) are completely unharmed by Bip300.

    <div id="intro-22" class="critique-target" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">Peter doesn't really know what he is complaining about. Nonetheless, for fun, we can do a small analysis of the "fixed costs" and "economies of scale" of "sha256d" hashes. The results may surprise you.<br><br>
      <strong>According to Peter, it is bad whenever the "fixed costs" of "hashing" are high.</strong> A Solana full node, for example, costs about $5000 / year (see Solana full node documentation, and related online profitability calculators). To Peter, the <em>mere presence</em> of such a cost, will "centralize mining", no matter what <em>revenues</em> it brings (which, of course, must be more than $5000, else no miner would run the Solana node).<br><br>
      <strong>What drives fixed costs of hashing? What drives "economies of scale" of hashing?</strong><br><br>
      First we must determine the demand for hashes. In Bitcoin's case, demand for "hashes" is set via difficulty adjustment. Every 2-week period, the full nodes gobble up exactly as many "hashes" as they think were actually produced in the previous 2-week period. (After which, the difficulty adjusts again, and the process repeats.)<br><br>
      Difficulty is set by: [1] Mining efficiency; and [2] Mining income.<br><br>
      Nonetheless I will explain the two. Efficiency is the hashes/$ rate. If all miners adopt a new ASIC that does 2x the hashes (but it otherwise the same cost), then soon after, difficulty will rise by a factor of 2. Income is driven by fees and the exchange rate. If the USD/BTC price doubled (but fees and efficiency stayed the same), then soon after, the difficulty would rise by 2x.<br><br>
      That is what determines the "scale" of mining -- ie. this is what determines the total number of hashes produced.<br><br>
      As that number switches from low to high (as it certainly has, from 2009 to the present day), we will be hashing at a larger and larger "scale". We will consume more electricity, we will transform more raw materials into ASIC chips, we will redirect the attention of businessmen and accountants and lawyers and other specialists.<br><br>
      In the long run, miners will have similar efficiency levels, and total mining costs will equal total mining revenues. If it were otherwise, difficulty would adjust until these two come into balance.<br><br>
      Therefore, whenever Bitcoin becomes more "successful" -- whenever the USD/BTC price rises, or whenever users pay more total tx fees -- total revenue will increase, and total costs will increase.<br><br>
      Total costs are skyrocketing. Therefore, fixed costs are rising. Aka -- Peter's "bad" outcome, the "centralization of mining" is exactly equal to, in every way Bitcoin becoming a success and having a high exchange rate and high fees and living for a long time.<br><br>
      The only way it could be otherwise, would be if every single new mining cost were always classified as "variable". But this is laughable -- in fact, you can download Marathon's public financial statements. You will see that they have "General and Administrative" costs in the tens of millions USD. Sometimes hundreds of millions. And that is a fixed cost! If anything -- Mara would pay that same amount, per year, if they did 10% the hashes, or (1/10th). It is because the total scale is going up, that a greater portion of the total costs will tend to be fixed. Exactly like how the hydroelectric dam is not economical until the electricity demand is high. A big operation means bigger fixed costs and bigger variable costs.

    <div id="intro-23" class="critique-target" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">Peter uses the phrases "economies of scale", and "fixed costs", but he doesn't quite understand what they mean.<br><br>
      They don't refer to inherent properties of things, they instead are bound to a <u>single decision-making situation</u>.<br><br>
      That situation is, in turn, bound to a context -- including, at minimum: <u>time horizon and the desired scale of output</u>.<br><br>
      For example, imagine we live in the 1920's, and we are considering whether to build a massive hydroelectric dam to provide electrical power to a small city. We compute the "fixed" cost of the dam, the "variable" cost of each watt it could henceforth produce, the lifetime of the dam, and the total demand for electricity at various prices. We try to figure out if the upfront cost of the dam is worth it. When the electrical demand is small, then the dam is not worth it. The dam is overkill. The dam is a relatively expensive cost of getting the next watt. So in that case the dam represents a <u>diseconomy of scale</u>. But when the town grows larger, the analysis might change. In the new context, we might be grateful for the dam and count it as an <u>economy of scale</u>. Time horizon is also key -- "zoom out" and take the view of a "Monarch of the Continent" who will rule for the next 200 years -- in that case, all of these fixed costs become variable. The King is just choosing how many dams he wants to build, and where. And how much electricity to get, as a result. Or, you can "zoom in", and consider someone who has hired an electrician to come out "for the whole day", but who has finished their tasks early and is now sitting idle. Now a "variable cost" has become "fixed". An indeed, it has suddenly obtained "economies of scale". Tomorrow, the electrician will go back to being a variable cost that has no scale economies. Similarly, the dam has enormous <u>economies of scale</u>, at some scales, but not others. Moving 55% of the water through the dam is about as easy as moving 56%. But if we are at 100%, then this "economy of scale" instantly becomes a near-infinite "diseconomy of scale". It depends, on the scale.<br><br>
      So, Peter's sentence: "The economics of Bitcoin mining have <u>both</u> economies of scale and diseconomies of scale" is meaningless. It is as if Walter White would say: "The chemistries of Lithium have both heat and pressure". The words are there, but the meaning is not.</div>

      To me, this indicates that Peter has no idea what "mining centralization" is. Nor how to measure it.<br><br>
      After all, physicists have just one definition of "light". And they know <u>the</u> way to measure it. (If there is a 2nd "way", then the two measures are always 100% consistent.)<br><br>
      Imho, Peter should refrain from talking about miner centralization, until <u>after</u> he decides what it is.</div>

    <div id="intro-27" class="critique-target" style="background-color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 0.2)">Actually, Peter's logic implies that P2Pool centralizes mining. P2Pool pays miners out, as rapidly as possible. Thus, each participant consumes around 43 bytes in the coinbase, to create a new UTXO. Thus each new P2Pool miner, wastes 43-millionths of every 1 MB block.<br><br>
      So, if/when fee revenues are $10B per year, it will cost each miner a "fixed" $430,000 per year, to join P2Pool. If a miner isn't going to earn <u>profits</u> that are more than that, then they are out of the running. If instead they use a regular pool, not P2Pool, they don't have to pay this cost.<br><br>Some suggest that LN can remedy this problem.<br><br>
      Unfortunately, not so. LN still has an upfront cost for each new miner who joins: you must open a channel to them, and this channel must already contain all the money you intend to pay them (ie, inbound liquidity problem). Refreshing this channel costs bytes, and the channel comes with risk of having these funds frozen for 2 weeks.<br><br>
      One supreme irony, is that drivechain itself can be used to allow small miners to collect frequently from their large pools. They are simply paid out on a drivechain which exists for this purpose. This can be done for free, since the fee-rates on that chain will be near zero. Thus, it will always have room for new miners, even if they are ultra-small. Miner's funds will be safe in a hashrate escrow, since miners are the ones who enforce Bip300 withdrawals.<br><br>
      So, Drivechain actually <u>decentralizes</u> mining, more than StratumV2 / p2pool / braidpool.
